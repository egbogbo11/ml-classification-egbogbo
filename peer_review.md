Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?) 
- Binyam's notebook was structured very vell and easy to follow. His notebook had numbered sections and his graphs and reflections were displayed correctly and neat. 
Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
- Reading through his notebook, the chosen feature he selected for the objective of spam detection makes sense. He chose his features because it has the ability to identify words that are typically used in spam emails like free. 
Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
- His results are displayed correctly and his explanation about his finding were understandable and made sense to his objective. 
Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
